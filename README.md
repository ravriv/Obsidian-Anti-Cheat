- Enchantment validation: OAC checks if enchantments on items exceed their maximum level or have invalid values.
- Ban list management: OAC maintains a ban list of players who have been caught cheating and automatically bans them from the server.
- Admin commands: OAC provides admin commands to manage the ban list, view banned players, and perform other administrative tasks.
- Entity control: OAC prevents the spawning of specific entities, such as command block minecarts, NPCs, and withers, to maintain server integrity.
